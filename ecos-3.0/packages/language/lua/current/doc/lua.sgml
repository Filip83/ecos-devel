      <para>
The Lua package consists of a Lua 5.2.3 port that can be called from code, but is integrated with TELNETD as a command.
</para>

      <title>Lua Organization</title>
      <para>
Lua consists of a package with little configuration. TELNETD has a configuration item to enable Lua via a telnet client. From the telnet client the user can use Lua just as if it was run from a shell on a laptop. For example, one could issue the following command from the telnet prompt: <literal>lua -v</literal>, which will print the version information. If Lua is put into interactive mode, leaving interactive mode closes the telnet client.</para>
      <para>
Lua was modified for eCos. The main change was to support input/output to/from any stream, rather than stdin/stdout. The <literal>lua_State</literal> structure has three streams added to it:</para>
      <programlisting>

struct lua_State {
  CommonHeader;
  lu_byte status;
  
...

  FILE *io_output;
  FILE *io_input;
  FILE *io_error;
};


</programlisting>
      <para>
The main call <literal>lua_main</literal> takes the same three parameters:</para>
      <programlisting>
int lua_main (
    FILE *output, 
    FILE *input, 
    FILE *error, 
    int argc, char **argv) {

</programlisting>
      <para>
</para>
      <para>
The TELNETD command calls this main function with the command line parameters. The three streams are created by calling <literal>fdopen(...)</literal> on the TELNETD socket.
</para>
      <para>
To use Lua from another context, such as for RS232, you can call this main function with stdin/stdout, etc.</para>

      <title>Lua Configuration</title>
      <para>
There is only one Lua configuration item.</para>
      <sect2>
        <title>
          <literal>CYGPKG_LUA_CFLAGS_ADD</literal>
        </title>
        <para>
This option configures Lua by controller defines just as if it was compiled as a desktop application. In general, there should be no need to change this.
</para>

        <title>
          <literal>CYGPKG_LUA_ROOT</literal>
        </title>
        <para>
This is the root dir of Lua. The root dir is used when Lua searches for packages on the file system.
