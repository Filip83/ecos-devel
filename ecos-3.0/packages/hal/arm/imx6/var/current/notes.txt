The code in the var tree should be generic accross all iMX6Q devices. Note that
it is not generic accross the whole iMX6 set of devices. This means it will not
support iMX6D. The main issue is that the SD register set is slightly different
as well as code.

If the long term goal is to support 1,2, and 4 cores, then a subset of the
registers may have to be moved to the specific processor. Then that leaves
the issue of whether two dimensions of flexibility, number of cores, and 
board, must be supported. Boards typically commit to a number of cores,
so perhaps only one dimension is enough.

The near term goal is to support other iMX6Q boards, not to support other 
numbers of cores. In this case, the registers will be consistent from board
to board.
