      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>
The <emphasis>eCos</emphasis> TELNETD package provides a simple TELNET
server for use with applications in eCos. This server is specifically
aimed at the remote control and monitoring requirements of embedded
applications. For this reason the emphasis is on application added commands. It is
<emphasis>not</emphasis> intended to be a general purpose shell.
</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="net-httpd-organization">
      <title>Server Organization</title>
      <para>
The server consists of one or more threads running in parallel to any
application threads and which support telnet sessions to clients. Apart from
supporting commands, the application does not need to do anything to
start the TELNET server.
</para>
      <para>
The TELNET server is, by default, started by a static constructor. This
simply creates an initial thread and sets it running. Since this is
called before the scheduler is started, nothing will happen until the
application calls <function>cyg_scheduler_start()</function>. The
server thread can also be started explicitly by the application, see
the <literal>CYGNUM_TELNETD_SERVER_AUTO_START</literal> option for
details.
</para>
      <para>
When the thread gets to run it first optionally delays for some period
of time. This is to allow the application to perform any
initialization free of any interference from the TELNET server. When the
thread does finally run it creates a socket, binds it to the TELNET
server port, and puts it into listen mode. It will then create any
additional TELNETD server threads that have been configured before
becoming a server thread itself.
</para>
      <para>
Each TELNETD server thread simply waits for a connection to be made to
the server port. When the connection is made it opens a socket, negotiates operation parameters, and enters a state machine for processing commands. The server will ask the client to use LINEMODE if supported by the client,  will process SLC and MODE commands, but will ignore their contents.</para>
      <para>The TELNETD server also starts one monitor thread per server thread. Each monitor thread watches for a client abort and cleans up. Clean up includes killing the command thread and recreating it. To prevent side effects, the TELNETD server supports using one instance of dlmalloc per thread and passing the object to the command. In addition, to prevent deadlocks, the monitor thread will unlock the stream associated with the FILE *, attempting to minimiz the  side effects on other threads that may be accessing the lock.</para>
      <para>
Commands are stored in tables. Each table entry contains a command pattern string, a
pointer to a handler function, and a user defined argument for the
function. Table entries are defined using the same link-time table
building mechanism used to generate device tables. This is all handled
by the <literal>CYG_TELNETD_TABLE_ENTRY()</literal> macro which has the
following format:
</para>
      <programlisting>

#include &lt;cyg/telnetd/telnetd.h&gt;

CYG_TELNETD_TABLE_ENTRY( __name, __pattern, __handler, __arg )

</programlisting>
      <para>
The <parameter>__name</parameter> argument is a variable name for the
table entry since C does not allow us to define anonymous data
structures. This name should be chosen so that it is unique and does
not pollute the name space. The <parameter>__pattern</parameter>
argument is the match pattern. The <parameter>__handler</parameter>
argument is a pointer to the handler function and
<parameter>__arg</parameter> the user defined value.
</para>
      <para>
The link-time table building means that several different pieces of
code can define server table entries, and so long as the patterns do
not clash they can be totally oblivious of each other. However, note
also that this mechanism does not guarantee the order in which entries
appear, this depends on the order of object files in the link, which
could vary from one build to the next. So any tricky pattern matching
that relies on this may not always work.
</para>
      <para>
A request command matches an entry in the table if either it exactly
matches the pattern string, or if the pattern ends in an asterisk, and
it matches everything up to that point. So for example the pattern
&quot;echo&quot; will only match that exact command,
but the pattern &quot;echo*&quot; will match
&quot;echo-1&quot;,
&quot;echo-2&quot; and any other command starting
with &quot;echo&quot;.
</para>
      <para>
When a pattern is matched, the hander function is called. It has the
following prototype:
</para>
      <programlisting>
cyg_bool cyg_telnetd_handler(FILE *client,
                           char *command,
                           int argc,
                           int *argv[],
                           void *arg,
                           void *user_data);
</programlisting>
      <para>
The <parameter>client</parameter> argument is the TCP connection to
the client: anything output through this stream will be returned to
the client. The <parameter>command</parameter> argument is the
command from the TELNET request and the <parameter>argc/argv</parameter>
arguments are the parsed arguments from the command. The
<parameter>arg</parameter> argument is the user defined value from the
table entry. The <literal>user_data</literal> argument is passed a NULL or a pointer to a <literal>Cyg_Mempool_dlmalloc</literal>.
</para>
      <para>
The handler is entirely responsible for generating the response to the
client, both command response and &lt;CR&gt;/&lt;NL&gt;. If the handler decides that it
does not want to generate a response it can return
<literal>false</literal>, in which case the table scan is resumed for
another match. If no match is found, or no handler returns true, then
a default response is generated indicating that the requested
command was not found.
</para>
      <programlisting>
cyg_bool cyg_telnetd_send_response(FILE *client,
                           char *response);
</programlisting>
      <para>
A send response command
aids the return of command data. Application code calling this function must be aware of whether the underlying network stack copies the response or holds a pointer to the response to ensure memory is not freed before the network stack is done sending the data. The send response function is responsible for appending any &lt;CR&gt;&lt;NL&gt; so that maintainers can ensure proper behavior for the negotiated settings.</para>
      <para>
Finally, the server thread closes the connection when the client sends a quit command or closes the session.
</para>

      <title>Server Configuration</title>
      <para>
The TELNET server has a number of configuration options:
</para>
      <sect2>
        <title>
          <literal>CYGNUM_TELNETD_SERVER_PORT</literal>
        </title>
        <para>
This option defines the TCP port that the server will listen on. It
defaults to the standard TELNET port number 23. It may be changed to a
different number if, for example, another TELNET server is using the
main TELNET port.
</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>
          <literal>CYGNUM_TELNETD_THREAD_COUNT</literal>
        </title>
        <para>
The TELNET server can be configured to use more than one thread to
service TELNET sessions. If you expect to serve multiple clients, then it may be useful to increase
the number of server threads.</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>
          <literal>CYGNUM_TELNETD_THREAD_PRIORITY</literal>
        </title>
        <para>
The TELNET server threads can be run at any priority. The exact priority
depends on the importance of the server relative to the rest of the
system. The default is to put them in the middle of the priority range
to provide reasonable response without impacting genuine high priority
threads.
</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>
          <literal>CYGNUM_TELNETD_THREAD_STACK_SIZE</literal>
        </title>
        <para>
This is the amount of stack to be allocated for each of the TELNETD
threads. The actual stack size allocated will be this value plus the
values of <literal>CYGNUM_HAL_STACK_SIZE_MINIMUM</literal> and
<literal>CYGNUM_TELNETD_SERVER_BUFFER_SIZE</literal>.
</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>
          <literal>CYGNUM_TELNETD_SERVER_BUFFER_SIZE</literal>
        </title>
        <para>
This defines the size of the buffer used to receive the  TELNET request. If you expect to use particularly long commands or have
a lot of command parameters, this should be increased.
</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>
          <literal>CYGNUM_TELNETD_SERVER_AUTO_START</literal>
        </title>
        <para>
This option causes the TELNET Daemon to be started automatically during
system initialization. If this option is not set then the application
must start the daemon explicitly by calling
<function>cyg_telnetd_startup()</function>. This option is set by
default.
</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>
          <literal>CYGNUM_TELNETD_SERVER_DELAY</literal>
        </title>
        <para>
This defines the number of system clock ticks that the TELNET server
will wait before initializing itself and spawning any extra server
threads. This is to give the application a chance to initialize
properly without any interference from the TELNETD.
</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>
          <literal>CYGNUM_TELNETD_COMMAND_ECHO</literal>
        </title>
        <para>
This enables an ECHO command for debugging.
</para>

      <sect2>
        <title>
          <literal>CYGNUM_TELNETD_COMMAND_SH</literal>
        </title>
        <para>
This enables Shell commands.
</para>

      <sect2>
        <title>
          <literal>CYGNUM_TELNETD_COMMAND_LUA</literal>
        </title>
        <para>
This enables the Lua command.
</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>
          <literal>CYGPKG_TELNETD_COMMAND_DLMALLOC</literal>
        </title>
        <para>
This enables dlmalloc.
</para>

      <sect2>
        <title>
          <literal>CYGPKG_TELNETD_COMMAND_DLMALLOC_SIZE</literal>
        </title>
        <para>
This sets the size of the memory pool for dlmalloc. There is on pool per thread, so the total memory is the number of threads times this value
